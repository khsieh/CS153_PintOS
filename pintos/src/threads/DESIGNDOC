		     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

list wait_list - priority list for waiting threads that is sorted by decreasing wait time
thread sleep_ticks - member variable to track the number of ticks each thread must sleep

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

first ensures interrupt are enabled
disables the interrupt level
then saves the number of ticks to a member variable of the current thread called sleep_ticks
the thread is then blocked to sleep it and the interrupt level is restored to trigger the interrupt handler
the interrupt handler sees which threads need waking up and clocks down sleep_ticks to 0
this signals the thread is finished sleeping so it unblocks the thread

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

Keeping the ready list in sorted order. So that everytime the interrupt handler is called it doesn't have to iterate through the whole list. 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

ready list sets priority for waiting every time block is called

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

Interrupts are disable while timer_sleep reads through the sleep list. This prevents the interrupt handeler to be call, therefore preventing race condition to occur.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We chose this design because we initially just checked every thread for a positive sleep_ticks and waited for each
one but that does not account for race conditions so we decided to use a priority list

   	   	   PRIORITY SCHEDULING
		   ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

thread donate_priority - gets the priority level for a thread A and donates it to B
thread set_priority - sets the priority for a thread
thread get_priority - gets the priority for a thread
list ready_list - priority list to track awaiting threads to allocate cpu time

>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

I used a linked list to signal awaiting threads and help with priority donation. The list's head is the thread
with the highest priority and the tail the lowest. We would first lock the thread for head and once it finishes
running unlock the thread and donate its priority to the next thread in the list so that it can run and this loops
until finished.

	|----------------------------------------

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

When a high priority thread is inserted into the waiting list, the list will be updated with descending priorities. Whenever a priority donataion happens, the current list will be re-evaulated to re-order it in the proper way. 

>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

A priority donation occurs when the current thread, thread A, that holds the lock is executing an important job, and a higher priority thread, thread B, calls lock_acquire() on the same lock object. When this scenario happens, we would want to continue the current thread, A, and let it finish its job. However, for this to happen, thread A needs to have a higher or equivlent priority as thread B. We then donates a portion of thread B's priority to thread A so that it can continue to finish its current job.

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

As the lock_release() is called, it will iterate over the wait list of the specific lock. Each iteration will also execute recall_donation, which revoke the priority donation of each thread on the waiting list. 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid
>> this race?

A race condition may occur if a thread A is donating its priority to a thread B but after the critical section
thread B is resetting its priority but thread A is not finished reordering the ready list an incorrect order of 
priority may occur because the priority of B may be changed. My implementation would avoid this by disabling 
interrupts before donating the priority to act as a lock.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We chose this design because it reorders the ready list ensuring lower priority threads get run by donating the 
priority of the thread before which was higher
